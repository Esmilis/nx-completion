# Install

:construction: _This plugin is at its early stages._

1. Install the dependency:

```sh
apt install jq
```

Note: `jq` is a lightweight command-line JSON processor.

2. Clone the repository into the custom plugins directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jscutlery/nx-completion.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/nx-completion
```

3. Then load it as a plugin in your `.zshrc`:

```sh
plugins+=(nx-completion)
```
